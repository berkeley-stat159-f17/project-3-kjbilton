# Your Title here

## Overview
This readme should be written by you, providing a high-level summary for newcomers of what the repository is about, what's where, and what to do to either read the main article or run the various analyses.

You don't need to replicate your main scientific narrative here, a repository README is meant to convey to anyone who finds your repo a few high-level things, for example:

- Purpose of the repository.
- Basic instructions to use it: what to install, if any, what to run, etc.  This will vary a lot from repo to repo, so use your judgment.
- A brief description of what is where (e.g. what important directories are included).
- Licensing conditions.

Look around on Github for inspiration on what people include in their READMEs that you find useful and informative. The [Reproducible Research section](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks#reproducible-academic-publications) of the Jupyter Notebook Gallery includes a number of research-oriented links that may be useful.
